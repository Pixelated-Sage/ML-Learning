- **NumPy is the short form of numerical python
- **In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package.
- **NumPy is a package that defines a multi-dimension array object and associates fast math functions that operate on array.
- **It also has functions for working in domain of linear Algebra, etc.
- **It is the fundamental package for Scientific computing in Python.

## **Array

- **Collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Holds fixed number of items, and should be same type
- **It reduce size of code.

**Advantages
- A list can't directly handle Mathematical Operations, while Array can.
- An Array consumes less memory
- Array is faster then list.
- Array can't store different datatypes
